\section{Overview}
We went through all the reviews provided by the class-reviewers. It was a very professional exercise and we found some very helpful comments that made us realize the things that we had overlooked. However, we would also like to point out that some of the review comments seemed to stem from an miscomprehended conveyance of the information presented in the paper.

\section{Errata Items}

We added a reference image that compares the approach we have taken to other approaches that have been explored by researchers in the domain of signature forensics.
\\
\\
\\
Another change that we made to the paper was to add a distinct conclusion section. A couple of suggestions about discussion of some missing elements was covered in the conclusion as fit.
\\

\\
To be able to better justify the decision to move from feature space to distance space, a polar plot showing inter-genuine and genuine-forgery distances has been added. A minor change involved adding a citation pointer.
